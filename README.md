## Program Purpose

This program is designed to solve a quadratic equation, but it can do more than that. 

## Program Features

- Solve 0th, 1st and 2nd degree equations.
- Communicating with the user in different languages (the list of languages will be expanded).
- Testing computational functions

## Flags
This program supports the following flags (the list will be extended in the future)
- Start tests according to the test_arguments.txt file (--test test_arguments.txt). The list of files with tested input data can be expanded.
